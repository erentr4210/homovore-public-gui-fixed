/**
 * The ranking every module competes under for the {@link dev.leonetic.manager.SwapManager}'s
 * rationed per-tick {@link SwapMode#SILENT} swaps.
 *
 * <p>Higher wins. The numbers are spaced so a module can offset itself a step either way without
 * needing a new constant; only their order matters. They live in one file because the whole point
 * of the ranking is that it can be read as a list — a tick that cannot do everything should drop
 * the firework, never the crystal.
 *
 * <p>The budget is granted first-come and ranks one tick late (a packet already sent cannot be
 * recalled), so a priority here is a claim on the <i>next</i> tick, not a guarantee for this one.
 * Callers must still handle refusal by retrying.
